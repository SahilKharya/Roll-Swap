# Roll Swap Dex

Building a RFQ (Request for Quote) Decentralized Exchanges

RFQ (Request for Quote) DEXs address several specific problems that can arise in traditional DEX environments including Front Running, Slippage Issues etc. RFQ systems can contribute to more efficient price discovery by allowing multiple market makers to provide competitive quotes directly to a trader, ensuring that the trader gets the best available price.

The swap utilizes chainlink price feed (Eth/USD currently), to help the the seller utilize the market price and request a better quotes. We tried to utilise Covalant Price History APIs to present a chart but due to some technical errors with the chart and time limitations, its not getting displayed in the final submission.


## Issues with verifying on Scan
The project is deployed using Scaffold Eth Template. 
The template provided easy way to deploy the token to the sepolia scroll network, however, after trying multiple time verify was not successfull.
This is my contract address deployed on the network- 0x93FB733ea2625D2D74569Ed6dF2Ce98467FEd250
